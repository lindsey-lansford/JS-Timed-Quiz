## JavaScript Timed Quiz
Timed Multiple Choice Quiz using JavaScript


### How it Works

This application runs in a browser and features a timed quiz with dynamically updated HTML and CSS code powered by Javascript. It presents the user with 4 multiple choice questions while recording how long it takes to complete the quiz. If the user selects the wrong answer, the timer deducts 10 seconds. At the end of the game, the user will submit their initials to record their score.
